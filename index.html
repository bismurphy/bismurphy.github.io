   <p>As you can see, this site is very... bare. I'm writing this on September 7, 2021. I ultimately decided to build this site because I wanted a place to share the random little passions I tend to get into as a person. If you share any of my passions, I hope you can find something that interests you here.
     <br>
     I'm on Twitter at @Spacecomm_Joey, and available via email at tjmurphy@mit.edu. That's a good segue to my professional life - I'm a student at MIT studying Aerospace Engineering. I got my bachelor's degree from MIT in 2019 and my masters in 2021. I'm currently enrolled in their PhD program.
     <br>
     If you enjoy anything about this site, please feel free to reach out to me and express your appreciation. If even a single person appreciates the stuff I post, it'll make me really happy and feel inclined to share.
     <br>
     Thank you for reading!

     Oh and also: I'm writing this website in raw HTML and I'm very new to this, so there are all kinds of HTML objects and features and elements and stuff I'm not familiar with. Therefore, if you know any ways to make this website better, I'd love to hear them :)
