     <p>  As you can see, this site is very... bare. I'm writing this on September
        7, 2021. I ultimately decided to build this site because I wanted a
        place to share the random little passions I tend to get into as a
        person. If you share any of my passions, I hope you can find something
        that interests you here.
     <br>
      I'm on Twitter at @Spacecomm_Joey, and available via email at
     tjmurphy mit.edu. That's a good segue to my professional life - I'm a
     student at MIT studying Aerospace Engineering. I got my bachelor's degree
     from MIT in 2019 and my masters in 2021. I'm currently enrolled in their
     PhD program.
     <br>
      If you enjoy anything about this site, please feel free to reach out to me
     and express your appreciation. If even a single person appreciates the
     stuff I post, it'll make me really happy and feel inclined to share.
     <br>
      Thank you for reading!

      Oh and also: I'm writing this website in raw HTML and I'm very new to this,
     so there are all kinds of HTML objects and features and elements and stuff
     I'm not familiar with. Therefore, if you know any ways to make this website
     better, I'd love to hear them :)
